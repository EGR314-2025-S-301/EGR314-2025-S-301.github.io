### Our Exhibit
The goal of our exhibit is to let people learn concepts through a demonstration of some type of STEM topic. We have determined that these topics must be related to something that these people have already been exposed to or will be. For example an exhibit of induction to children would be out of place but an exhibit of the color spectrum would be appropriate. The exhibit should also be interactive so that learning the concept or topic would be made easier. We don't want to make something that will just be stared at by an audience. We feel that having a user change variables will insure a higher change of a person learning the topic or concept displayed. 

Our audience will be 4th to 8th graders, as students in this age range are old enough to be trusted around more devices than children under this age range. Categorizing these students by grade also allows the team to understand what topics are appropriate for the age. The state of Arizona has standards for these grade levels, which can help inform what topics will be too advanced or too juvenile for our audience. 
## Preliminary research
In the article, “[Ideation in Practice: How Effective UX Teams Generate Ideas](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ideation-in-practice/)”, one of the things that can be challenging during the ideation process is a lack of user research. This is usually due to a lack of time for the ideation process. While our team did experience a time crunch during the ideation process, research was still done to give ourselves a basis for generating ideas.

Our team did preliminary research before generating ideas for 4th-8th graders. To do this, we found it necessary to research what children were learning in the STEM field. Each STEM field has its subcategories. In the science field, there is life science, physical science, and space/earth science. We found these subcategories and then sorted them into a table. Then for each of these subcategories we found topics relating to them. We made sure that these topics are plausible for 4th-8th graders to learn and that they have some concept of it before viewing/interacting with the project. From these topics we were able to then create ideas for a project. <br>
